All you have to do is 'source' the lscolors file into your shell startup script.<br />
For example:<br />
For bash: echo "source ~/lscolors" >> ~/.bashrc<br />
<br />
For Zsh: echo "source ~/lscolors" >> ~/.zshrc<br /><br />
I recommend installing LSDeluxe (lsd) command so you can have a full spectrum look at files with included icons that lsd provides. It should be available in any Linux repository.
